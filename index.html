<h1>Royal History Mystery</h1>
<p>This article discusses how King Charles is interested in investigating the bodies of 2 children found by the Tower of London to see if they are bodies of historical significance. This made news as Queen Elizebeth did not support the investigation of the bodies to see if they were specific children hundreds of years ago. 
	I found this article interesting because it shows how much history and the age of the Tower of London. Even as a significant building with a lot of known history, I thought that it was interesting that the building is so old that it has history that is unknown.
