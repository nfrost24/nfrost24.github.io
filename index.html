    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Ethan's News Article Review</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">As there are probably hundreds of thousands of history filled churches in Europe and as someone who loves good design this article really stood out to me. It goes over 10 
      churches from all over the world that got huge makeovers transforming the spaces to all kinds of things like climbing gyms, libraries, community spaces, restaurants, and some just updated the church space. In every case they managed to created very visually interesting architecture using the space efficiently in some unique ways. I found that the bbc offered drastically different 
      news on the home page depending on vpn usage which make sense due to the wanted to give you relate to information. The ads weren't too distracting and didn't take anything away from browsing 
      the site. The article was very informative mainly just showing off some unique architecture and designs of spaces. I was left wondering if the remodeling of churches was a growing trend? Bringing up questions also about how are old churches are being sold but this was all me probably reading a little too far into the article. Overall I simply really enjoyed looking at the 
      design of the unique spaces and the article was very similar to an article I could have found in a local news source.</p>

    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Noah's News Article Review</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">This article discusses how King Charles is interested in investigating the bodies of 2 children found by the Tower of London to see if they are bodies of historical significance. This made news as Queen Elizebeth did not support the investigation of the bodies to see if they were specific children hundreds of years ago. 
      I found this article interesting because it shows how much history and the age of the Tower of London. Even as a significant building with a lot of known history, I thought that it was interesting that the building is so old that it has history that is unknown. </p>

			<p>BindHQ is a company that builds software for insurance companies and helps integration from previous systems to their system. Their goal is to create a system that is effective enough in boosting productivity 
			that using their system earns a company more money than they spend on using it. The way that they do this is by working with the individual company that is integrating their software and building tools that work with their 
			specific requests. They also have general tools that they include to reduce manual data input and automating repetitive tasks.</p>

			<p>Something that they heavily advertise is that they donâ€™t have pay-to-use modules that must be purchased after the initial purchase of the software. They imply that other software companies will have hidden costs to use certain 
			features that end up increasing the cost of those particular softwares greater than what is expected. Their recommended plan is $350 a month, which they claim will include all the features they need to transfer over to this 
			new system and increase efficiency. </p>

			<p>Part of their integration efforts involve giving people lessons on how to use their systems before they even transfer their system. This way, the day that they transfer they can continue to function effectively. They also 
			advertise that they give tech support and lessons for use after integration to further help the transition process. </p>
